## Sellventory — User Guide

**Welcome!** This quick guide shows how to add items, what fields matter most, how search/sort/multi-select works, and how to back up or import/export your data. There’s also a short note on the desktop companion.

## How to Add an Item
1. **Tap “Add Item”** on the main screen.  
2. **Add a photo** (recommended): take a new photo or pick one from your gallery.  
3. **Fill key details** (see *Important Fields to Fill* below).  
4. **Tap Save**. Your item appears in the list and gallery.

> Tip: If you took the photo in-app, the **Bought Date** can auto-fill from the photo’s EXIF when available. You can edit it if needed.

---

## The Add / Update Screen
Typical fields you’ll see:
- **Title** – Short name of the item (e.g., “Vintage Copper Pot”).  
- **Photo** – Optional but strongly recommended for identification.  
- **Bought Date** – When you acquired it.  
- **Price (Paid)** – What you paid (used in simple reports later).  
- **Location** – Where you store it (shelf, bin, room, etc.).  
- **Tags** – Keywords like *tools, camera, 1970s, pottery*.  
- **Sold status / Price (Sold)** – If you sold it, record details here.  
- **Notes** – Anything useful: condition, provenance, buyer/seller info, etc.

Tap **Save** to commit changes, or **Back** to cancel.

## Important Fields to Fill
While everything helps later, these have the biggest impact:
1. **Title** – Makes search and lists meaningful.  
2. **Bought Date** – Useful for sorting and timeline reports.  
3. **Price (Paid)** – Helps with value summaries and ROI down the track.  
4. **Location** – Lets you filter/find where things are.  
5. **At least one Tag** – Powerful for grouping (e.g., *Nintendo*, *Lenses*, *Staging Box A*).

---

## Locations (and adding new ones)
- On **Add/Update**, tap the **Location** field.  
- Choose an existing location **or type a new one**; new entries are saved so they appear next time.  
- Use consistent names (e.g., *Shelf A1*, *Bin Blue 03*) to keep filters clean.

> Tip: If you’re reorganising, you can bulk-update locations from the main screen using multi-select.

---

## Tags (and adding new Tags)
- On **Add/Update**, tap **Tags** and either pick from the list or **type to add** a new tag.  
- Tags are saved and will show up as suggestions.  
- Use short, reusable words; avoid near-duplicates (e.g., “Lens” vs “Lenses”).

> Tip: You can add multiple tags to an item. Think categories (*brand, era, material, box label*).

---

## Main Screen Features

### Search
- Use the **search bar** to find items by **Title, Tags, or Location** (and often Notes).  
- Partial words work; try a brand, storage code, or keyword.

### Sort
- Use the **Sort** control to reorder by common fields like **Title, Bought Date, or Price**.  
- Your last choice is remembered for convenience.

### Hold to Multi-Select (Bulk Update/Delete)
- **Press-and-hold** an item to enter selection mode, then tap others to add them.  
- Use the bottom or top **bulk actions** to:
  - **Update** selected items (e.g., change **Location** or **Add/Replace Tags**).  
  - **Delete** selected items (moves them to deleted/removed in the DB; see Import rules below).

---

## Backup, Import & Export

**Backup** (on phone):  
- Use **Export** in the app to create a file containing your data (and, in the full version, images).  
- Save to your phone, SD card, or a cloud drive.

**Import** (on phone):  
- Use **Import** to restore from a previous export.  
- **Merges** changes: newer edits win. Deleted items stay deleted (tombstoned) so they **don’t re-appear** on import.

> If you also use the **Sellventory Companion** on desktop, you can export from Android, edit/view/report on desktop, and **export back** to Android.

### Best-practice naming
Use a consistent scheme so you always know what’s newest:
