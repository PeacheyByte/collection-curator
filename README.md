# Sellventory

**Track, manage, and simplify your reselling workflow.**

Sellventory is designed for anyone who buys and resells — whether it’s collectibles, tech, or handmade goods. The app helps you keep control of your inventory with:

- 📸 Item photos — snap and store images of each item  
- 🏷 Tags & locations — organise your collection the way you want  
- 💰 Purchase & sale tracking — know exactly what you paid, listed, and sold for  
- 📊 Reports & exports — generate spreadsheets or backups at any time  
- 🖥 Windows & Linux Companion — manage and view your data on a bigger screen  

Everything runs locally on your device. No cloud lock-in, no accounts needed. Just you and your inventory.
